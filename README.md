# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship

This was one of great experience i had in terms of understanding real data, how industry works given a dataset. What all process are involved right from data gathering, exploration to visualization dashboards. How to tackle the problem in effective way sticking to the business context.

It had 3 tasks mainly - 
1) Data Quality Assessment.
2) Data Insights.
3) Data Insights and Presentation.

## Data Quality Assessment -
I had given a dataset with customer's demographics, transaction data and customer address data of a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation named Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. The organisation had a large dataset relating to its customers, and I had to analyse it to help optimise their marketing strategy. 

Main aspects I had to work was Data Quality, ensuring all the data I had was in right format, relevant. I had to create an email draft to the client, list down these quality issues and strategies to mitigate those.

## Data Insights -
I created a few more dimensions with the transactions and customer demographics such as Age, profits.

I used RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for analyzing high valued customers from the given data, calculate R score, F and M scores. Segment the customers with respect to these 3 factors in 4 segments such as Platinum, Silver, Gold, Bronze. I also considered job_industry_category, age groups, past orders, wealth segment to analyze a trend in the customers purchases.

Finally I created Presentation to showcase these customer segment analysis, which customer segments to target w.r.t to the factors i considered.


## Data Insights and Presentation -
After customer analysis on the past transactions and customers data, I took the same factors to analyze the new customers list provided to showcase these high valued customers. Using Tableau created dashboard to provide key insights.

## Tools used -

Excel, Pivot tables, Charts, Tableau
